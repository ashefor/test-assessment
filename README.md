# Frontend Assessment

Build and deploy a very simple frontend app for paginated data, that does the following

1.  Fetches data from `https://randomapi.com/api/8csrgnjw?key=LEIX-GF3O-AG7I-6J84` which can be paged by appending `&page=N` where N is the page you want to fetch. E.g appending `&page=1` retrieves the first page, while `&page=4` retrieves the 4th page.

2.  Displays the fetched data in a HTML table and allows the user to page next/previous with buttons in the UI

3.  Implement edit and delete buttons for each row. 

4.  Add a search input at the top of the table for server searching

#### Note

1.  You are to build this project with [Ant Design](https://ng.ant.design/) for handing the styling or UI. 
2.  This project duration is 1(One) Hour.
